The participants pose as typical students–attending classes, making friends and participating in school clubs and activities–to provide an inside look at what it's like to be a teenager today. Each with personal motivations driving them to help enact positive change, the participants, unaware of each other, arrive on campus where only the school administrators and select members of the community know their true identities and the reason for their semester-long stay. From bullying and the pervasiveness of social media to the struggle to excel in the classroom and navigate evolving social standards, participants discover the challenges and complexities, both new and familiar, facing today's teens.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

While in prison, Dick Hickock, 28, hears a cellmate's story about $10,000 in cash kept in a home safe by a prosperous farmer. When he's paroled, Dick persuades ex-con Perry Smith, 31, to join him in going after the stash.</p><p>On a November night in 1959, Dick and Perry break into the Holcomb, Kansas, farm house of Herbert Clutter and family. Enraged at finding no safe, they wake the four sleeping Clutters and brutally kill them all. The bodies are found by friends who come by before Sunday church. The murders shock the small Great Plains town, where doors are routinely left unlocked.

      "<p> Since their divorce 29 years ago, Jacques and Francine have seen little. They meet again today, while Jacques receives a badge of honor to commemorate his work at the Mémoires Vives Foundation, an organization that assists the relatives of missing persons, whose founders they are. Despite their differences, Jacques and Francine are united by a common tragedy, that of the disappearance of their little daughter Laurie thirty years ago. Jacques's second wife, Claire, also wears a moving secret that will soon burst into the open. For three years, she has lived alone in the family home of Saint-Hilaire where she and Jacques have raised their two daughters. Claire is finally ready to open her heart to a new lover. Bright memories, it is the story of families haunted despite themselves by a still alive past.

Цього разу на глядачів чекає захоплююча подорож по Латинській Америці. «Латиноамериканський CHECK-IN» вийде в ефір НЛО TV вже цієї осені, а його ведучими стали знайомі тобі з «Американського CHECK-IN» Євген Славкінський і Ілля Луценко. Хлопці побували в дев'яти країнах: Мексиці, Коста-Ріці, Панамі, Еквадорі, Перу, Болівії, Чилі, Аргентині і Бразилії. Крім унікальних кадрів місцевої природи і колоритних жителів, знімальна група привезла з собою безліч цікавих історій про свою вельми небезпечну подорож.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
